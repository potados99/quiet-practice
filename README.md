# quiet-proxy

SOCKS4/5 proxy built on top of [quiet modem](https://github.com/quiet).

Some modifications have been made to make [quiet-lwip](https://github.com/quiet/quiet-lwip) compatible with the [changed quiet-to-portaudio interface](https://github.com/quiet/quiet-lwip/issues/3#issuecomment-364797530).
